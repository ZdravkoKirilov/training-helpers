# Todo API

## How to run

- It's reccommended to use nodejs v16 at least, since that was used to create the project
- Open a terminal in the "todo-app" folder and run ```npm i```
- Once ready, run ```npm start```
- If everything wen't fine, you'll see a console message that the app is running
- The app doesn't use a real database and keeps everything in memory. If you wish
to clean the data - simply restart the server.


## Has 4 endpoints

1. GET /todos => returns all todos

2. POST /todos => creates a new Todo. Expects the following data:

```js
{
    title: [String ] [Required] [5-100 characters] [Unique],
    description: [String] [Optional] [10-300 characters]
}
```

3. PUT /todos => edits an existing Todo. The payload must contain "id" field. Can update one or all of the following fields:

```js
{
    title: [String ] [5-100 characters] [Unique],
    description: [String] [10-300 characters],
    completed: [Boolean],
}
```

4. DELETE /todos/:todoId - deletes a Todo. The "todoId" param is required.
